# go-webapp-boilerplates
Basic boilerplates for web applications with the backend written in Golang.

## Database Branch
This branch is the boilerplate for a basic web application that has a need for a database. The branch "master" contains the boilerplate with less packages/files that removes the database functionality from the boilerplate.

This boilerplate uses [boltdb/bolt](https://www.github.com/boltdb/bolt) for its database storage and operations. The dependency is managed by the package [golang/dep](https://www.github.com/golang/dep).
